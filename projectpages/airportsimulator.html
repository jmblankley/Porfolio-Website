      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a dynamic Airport Traffic Simulation as a hands-on learning
        project to delve into the intricacies of concurrent programming.
        Utilized threads, semaphores, and shared memory to ensure a
        collision-free environment on the runway. The simulation takes inputs
        such as the number of flights to be completed and the current passenger
        count in the airport, optimizing the scheduling and coordination of
        flights.
      </p>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>Sole Engineer</p>
      <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Engineered the simulation to ensure a collision-free environment on
          the runway through effective coordination of aircraft movements using
          threading and synchronization mechanisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented algorithms for efficient simulation,
          considering factors such as runway usage and passenger counts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized shared memory for seamless communication between threads,
          enabling real-time data exchange and enhancing simulation accuracy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        This project served as a valuable learning experience, deepening my
        understanding of concurrent programming concepts. The successful
        implementation of threads, semaphores, and shared memory not only
        ensured a collision-free runway but also honed my skills in designing
        and optimizing complex systems.
