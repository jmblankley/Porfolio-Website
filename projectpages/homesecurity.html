      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a comprehensive Home Monitoring/Security System using a
        combination of React, C++, HTML, CSS, and SQL. The project integrates
        NodeMCUs as input sensors strategically placed around my house,
        including door sensors and temperature sensors. Two distinct React
        applications were designed for this system: one functions as a desktop
        program, while the other operates as a mobile app on a phone. The
        desktop app, hosted on a Raspberry Pi, serves as a central hub for
        monitoring various house data, including real-time notifications for
        opened doors. The mobile app offers the same functionality but ensures
        mobility for remote house monitoring.
      </p>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>Sole Developer and Designer</p>
      <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conceptualized, designed, and developed all aspects of the application
          to meet specific security and status monitoring requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overcame the challenges of creating sensors using NodeMCUs,
          contributing to a deeper understanding of hardware integration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hosted and maintained the app on a private server within a closed
          network environment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        The fully functional Home Security/Status System provides real-time
        insights into house security and status. The application is securely
        hosted on a private server within a closed network, ensuring complete
        control and privacy. The testing version of the app is is available to
        view but only has testing sensors integrated. The fully functioning app
        is being used in my home on a private application and server.
      </p>
      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>React, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Node.js</p>
